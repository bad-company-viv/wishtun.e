# Funnel Strategy V2 (Corrected & High-Converting)

My previous analysis was too generic. After deep-diving `riagupta.com`, here is the **REAL** winning formula we must build.

## 🚨 The Core Pivot: Direct Response, Not E-Commerce
Wishtune isn't a "store". It's a **movement**.
- **Old Idea**: Landing Page -> Product Grid -> Checkout.
- **New Idea**: Squeeze Page (Free Gift) -> One-Time Offer (OTO) -> High Ticket Upsell.

---

## 1️⃣ The "Hook" (Psychology)
**"Manifestation should not feel like homework."**
This is the killer value prop.
- **Problem**: People try to manifest with "more effort" (journaling, rituals).
- **Solution**: "Just listen during your normal day." (Sleep, Shower, Party).
- **Mechanism**: "Real music mixed with belief-focused audio design." (Patent Pending).

## 2️⃣ The Funnel Architecture

### **Step 1: The Squeeze Page (Entry Point)**
**Goal**: Get the email. DO NOT try to sell yet.
- **Headline**: "Attract Your Dreams While You Shower, Sleep, or Party."
- **Offer**: "Get the World's First Manifestation Song for FREE."
- **CTA**: [Send it to me please]
- **No Navigation links**: Trap them in the offer.

### **Step 2: The "Tripwire" / Bridge Page**
**Goal**: Turn lead into customer immediately.
- **Message**: "Your free song is in your inbox... BUT..."
- **Upsell**: "Accelerate your results with our Best-Selling 'Shower Mixtape'."
- **Price**: ₹999 (Low barrier to entry).
- **Urgency**: "One-time offer".

### **Step 3: The Core Offer (Dashboard/Store)**
**Goal**: High-Ticket Sales.
- **Sleep Mixtape**: ₹2,499.
- **Party Mixtape**: ₹1,999.
- **Bundles**: "Get all 3 for ₹3,999".

---

## 3️⃣ Design Direction (V2)
**Aesthetic**: "Cyber-Spiritual Luxury"
- **Colors**: Deep Purple/Black (The Void/Creation) + Neon Gold (Manifestation).
- **Vibe**: Not "hippie". It should feel like a *Tech Product* or *High-End Fashion*.
- **Fonts**: Big, Bold Serif headlines (Vogue style) + Monospace constraints (Science/Data style).

---

## 4️⃣ Execution Plan V2

### **Phase 1: The Asset Build**
1.  **Squeeze Page**: Minimalist, hypnotic background video, big input field.
2.  **"How It Works" Module**: 4 Steps (Pick -> Play -> Relax -> Manifest).
3.  **OTO Checkout**: A simplified checkout page just for the "Shower Mixtape".

### **Phase 2: The Tech**
- **Lead Capture**: Integrate with a mock email service.
- **Audio Delivery**: Secure link after email submission.
