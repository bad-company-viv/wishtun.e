# **🔁 THE FUNNEL (HOW YOU ACTUALLY SELL THIS)**

## **STEP 1: Emotion-Authority Landing Page**

### **Above the fold message:**

**“Sound designed to calm high-performing minds.”**

Subtext:

Created by a psychologist & DJ who understands both the mind and sound.

CTA:

**Find Your Mental State**

---

## **STEP 2: Identity-Based Segmentation (NOT generic categories)**

Instead of:

* Sleep

* Party

* Shower

Use:

* 🧠 Overthinking at Night

* 🩺 High-Pressure Workdays

* 🌙 Deep Sleep Reset

* ✨ Personal Sound Therapy

This makes doctors & premium users feel **seen**.

---

## **STEP 3: Founder Authority (Ria Gupta \= Secret Weapon)**

You have something Calm & BrainSync don’t.

### **Ria Gupta is:**

* Psychologist → trust, credibility

* DJ → sound mastery, vibe control

* Founder → personal vision

### **How to position her:**

“Designed by a psychologist who understands the mind, and a DJ who understands how sound moves people.”

This bridges:

🧠 Science \+ 🎶 Art

That’s rare. That’s premium.

## **STEP 4: Product Pages \= Therapy-Style Framing**

Instead of:

“Sleep Mixtape – 60 min”

Say:

**Sleep Reset Session**  
Designed to quiet mental chatter and prepare your nervous system for rest.

Bullet points:

* Created using psychological calming principles

* Designed to guide the brain into rest

* Ideal for overthinkers & insomniacs

---

## **STEP 5: Proof Without Overexplaining**

Use:

* “Used by professionals, doctors & creatives”

* “Designed for minds that don’t switch off easily”

* Testimonials focused on **mental quiet**, not music quality

---

## **STEP 6: Pricing Psychology**

Doctors & premium users:

* Don’t want cheap

* Want effective

* Want simple

Price \= **signal of seriousness**, not value comparison.

# **🎤 HOW TO MARKET RIA GUPTA (VERY IMPORTANT)**

### **❌ Don’t say:**

* “Hi, I’m Ria Gupta, founder of Wishtune”

### **✅ Say:**

“Wishtune was created by Ria Gupta — a psychologist and DJ who spent years studying how sound affects the mind.”

Visuals:

* Minimal portraits

* Studio / headphone / console vibes

* Calm authority, not influencer energy

---

# **🧠 WHY A USER WILL BUY (ONE-LINER)**

If a doctor or Gen Z user asks:

“Why should I buy this?”

The answer is:

“Because it helps your mind let go — without effort, without distraction, without commitment.”
